  <h1><a href="/2012/01/17/farewell-senator.html">Farewell Senator</a></h1>
  <p class="author">
    <span class="meta">2012-01-17 00:00:00 -0500</span>
  </p>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I awoke to some sad news in Central Florida yesterday. <em>The Senator</em>, an ancient cypress tree and one of the area&#39;s most beloved landmarks was <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/seminole/os-senator-cypress-tree-fire-20120116,0,6171920.story">felled by fire early Monday morning</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Senator</em> was more than 3,500 years old and one of the largest Cypress trees in the United States at 127 feet tall and 47 feet in circumference. While it had seen better days -- a hurricane lopped 40 feet off the top in 1925 -- the tree remained an impressive visage and a primordial reminder of Central Florida&#39;s history.</p>

<p>Once a beacon to Central Florida travelers, <em>The Senator</em> lost some of its appeal when Disney arrived in Central Florida with Sea World and Universal Studios in tow. Indeed, even though Micki and I settled just one mile from its location when we first moved to Central Florida a decade ago, I only made one visit to the secluded site in 2005.</p>

<p>It is humbling to think that something which survived more than three millennia could come to such an unfortunate end and I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed <em>The Senator&#39;s</em> grandeur in person.</p>

<p>I took along a camera on that 2005 visit. Below is a small selection of images from that impromptu shoot:</p>

    <p><em>Audible bell.</em> Not a sensible default, in the sense that it grates on my senses. First thing I do is rush headlong into Terminal.app&#39;s preferences and change it to <em>Visual bell</em>. Can be found via <em>Settings &gt; Advanced</em>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org">This American Life</a>, unsurprisingly, timed the release of &quot;Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory&quot; perfectly in light of all the attention the tech media is lavishing upon the <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">Consumer Electronics Show (CES)</a>.</p>

<p>I love new technology as much as the next geek, but it is easy to lose sight of what goes into putting those shiny objects in our hands year after year.</p>

<p>As is wont for <em>This American Life</em>, they have produced a well-spun yarn that tackles a difficult issue from a variety of angles. Well worth the listen.</p>

    <p>A decade has passed since I left the newspaper business and probably not a day too soon. As <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire">The Wire</a> taught us, the newspaper industry in its current form is dying and many of the existing jobs therein are withering along with it.</p>

<p>In my journalistic heyday, I was writing tens of thousands of words per week. It was easy and I was good at it. In the immortal words of Biggie, however, &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdciOXroU9o" title="Earmuffs">Things done changed</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Writing is still part of my day-to-day life. I write at work. I write, perhaps too often, on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dameyer">Twitter</a>. I write more emails than I care to think about. Despite all this writing, I find it more difficult with each passing day to formulate coherent thoughts and put those thoughts to paper/screen.</p>

<p>The only way I know to rectify this issues is to write. To push through the malaise and bang out content. That is where this site comes into play.</p>

<p>This site has existed, in some form or another, for nearly seven years. It started with the now-defunct <a href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20041015221909/http://www.themeyerfiles.com/">The Meyer Files</a>, which was created to keep our families in the loop after my wife and I moved 1,500 miles and a way-of-life away. The site meandered aimlessly for seven years and this is what it has become. Pointless, egotistical and not worth saving.</p>

<p>That needs to change. I need to be proud of what is posted here. I need to believe it has value. We all need that. To believe that what we do matters. That we matter.</p>

<p>Writing is something I once loved and the modern miracles of technology and a free society have given me the perfect vehicle with which I can rekindle that flame. A platform if not an audience.</p>

<p>Have said all that, here is what I hope to accomplish going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create more original content</li>
<li>Write on whatever topics pique my interest</li>
<li>Write on a schedule</li>
<li>Most importantly, write more often</li>
</ul>

<p>Please bear with me as I set things up. I have some infrastructure issues to tackle before I get down to writing on a regular basis.
Thanks for your patience and please check back soon and often!</p>
