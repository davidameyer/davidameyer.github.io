          <h2>Starting Fresh</h2>
<p class="meta">04 May 2011</p>

<div class="post">
<p>A decade has passed since I left the newspaper business and probably not a day too soon. As <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire">The Wire</a> taught us, the newspaper industry in its current form is dying and many of the existing jobs therein are withering along with it.</p>

<p>In my journalistic heyday, I was writing tens of thousands of words per week. It was easy and I was good at it. In the immortal words of Biggie, however, &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdciOXroU9o" title="Earmuffs">Things done changed</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Writing is still part of my day-to-day life. I write at work. I write, perhaps too often, on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dameyer">Twitter</a>. I write more emails than I care to think about. Despite all this writing, I find it more difficult with each passing day to formulate coherent thoughts and put those thoughts to paper/screen.</p>

<p>The only way I know to rectify this issues is to write. To push through the malaise and bang out content. That is where this site comes into play.</p>

<p>This site has existed, in some form or another, for nearly seven years. It started with the now-defunct <a href="http://replay.web.archive.org/20041015221909/http://www.themeyerfiles.com/">The Meyer Files</a>, which was created to keep our families in the loop after my wife and I moved 1,500 miles and a way-of-life away. The site meandered aimlessly for seven years and this is what it has become. Pointless, egotistical and not worth saving.</p>

<p>That needs to change. I need to be proud of what is posted here. I need to believe it has value. We all need that. To believe that what we do matters. That we matter.</p>

<p>Writing is something I once loved and the modern miracles of technology and a free society have given me the perfect vehicle with which I can rekindle that flame. A platform if not an audience.</p>

<p>Have said all that, here is what I hope to accomplish going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create more original content</li>
<li>Write on whatever topics pique my interest</li>
<li>Write on a schedule</li>
<li>Most importantly, write more often</li>
</ul>

<p>Please bear with me as I set things up. I have some infrastructure issues to tackle before I get down to writing on a regular basis.
Thanks for your patience and please check back soon and often!</p>
