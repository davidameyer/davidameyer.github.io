My name is David A. Meyer. I am 39 years old. I was born in New Jersey, grew up in Western New York and have lived in Central Florida since 2001 with my best friend and wife, Micki. We have a son, James, who has turned our lives upside-down in the best ways imaginable.

For the past 12 years, I have worked in marketing for a global commercial real estate firm. Before that, I was a sportswriter and editor for [Messenger-Post Newspapers](http://www.mpnnow.com/) in Rochester, New York. Other jobs included, but were not limited to:

* Patching roads, flagging traffic and retrieving road kill
* Mass-producing bolts, nuts and screws
* Making boxes
* Washing dishes (Why yes, I am certified in New York State.)
* Bar-backing
* Slinging sandwiches, cold cuts and produce for [Danny](http://www.wegmans.com) like every other upstanding upstate teen

Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be a professional baseball player. Needless to say, that did not happen. I made it as far as a [low-level Division I program in northern Indiana](http://www.valpo.edu), but mostly in the role of mascot.

I bounced around a bit and eventually received degrees in Communications and Liberal Arts from [Monroe Community College](http://www.monroecc.edu) before earning a B.S. in Communications with a Political Science minor at the [State University of New York (SUNY) College at Fredonia](http://www.fredonia.edu).

I love to read, watch movies and enjoy _good_ television -- when I can find it. Technology fascinates me. I don't have much use for politics or politicians. Photography remains a passion despite dwindling time and resources. Personal fitness and diet have become central to my life since learning I would be a father at a relatively advanced age (I would like to stick around).

Finally, I am a die-hard Pittsburgh sports fan. The [Steelers](http://www.pittsburghsteelers.com), [Pirates](http://www.pittsburghpirates.com), [Penguins](http://www.pittsburghpenguins.com) and [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com) have been my unhealthy obsession for the past 30 years.
